# student_mgmt

I will be working on a student course registration system application for a school. The system will have the ability to add students as well as course.



What are various features you would like your project to offer?
I will like the application to support two classes of users, administrator and students.
I will like the project to offer features for listing, adding, removing and modifying student	 information. I will also like the same feature to apply to the courses the school offers.


What are the API endpoints that you would need to set up for each feature? List them along with the respective HTTP verb, endpoint URL, and any special details (query parameters, request bodies, headers).

GET /api/student
POST /api/student
UPDATE /api/student/<id:int>
DELETE /api/student/<id:int>

GET /api/course
POST /api/course
UPDATE /api/course/<id:int>
DELETE /api/course/<id:int>
